### Timeblocker
1. **Actions** represented by **Blocks**
    * Each block represents a recurring daily task
    * Block sizes are based on how long their corresponding task takes to complete
2. **Drag and Drop** blocks into the **Schedule**
    * Hours are split into four quadrants, representing 15 minutes each
        * Blocks snap to the nearest 15 minute quadrant
        * No overlapping blocks: a block will automatically shift downward until it fits cleanly
    * The schedule starts at 5:30 am and ends at 9:30pm (16 hours total)
3. Quality of life features and future additions
    * You can move already-placed blocks around with dragging and dropping
    * An arrow (or any kind of visual indicator) shows what time of day it is
        * Highlighted row shows the current hour and corresponding quadrant
    * Blocks only ever touch at edges, never overlap visually
    * Everything is rectangular, aligned, and consistent
